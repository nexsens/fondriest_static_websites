		<h1>Water Quality Sensors</h1>
		
		<div id="col-1">
		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<p>The chemical, physical and biological conditions of water combined form its quality. Even
		minute changes in these characteristics can jeopardize the life and industries that depend
		on water. To preserve its quality, monitoring water parameters such as conductivity, pH,
		salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen and turbidity is crucial. Fondriest Environmental
		offers a broad selection of water quality sensors that cater to both simple spot sampling
		requirements and complex unattended monitoring projects.</p>
		
			<h3>Temperature</h3>
			<p>Water temperature could be the most frequent parameter measured. It is altered daily by
			weather conditions, and, over time, by climate change and environmental degradation.
			Water temperature affects living organisms as many organisms use temperature as a signal
			for when to reproduce and when to migrate. Water temperature has a tremendous impact
			on water density which controls stratification. Temperature measurement technology comes
			standard on many multi-parameter meters and sondes.</p>

			<h3>pH</h3>
			<p>In an industrial world, pH is the immediate indicator of water quality change. Pollution from
			acid mine drainage, acid rain and industrial discharge can quickly alter the normal pH of a
			water system. Constant monitoring through real-time data can help restore a body of water
			to a healthy environment before it becomes toxic.</p>

		</div>
		<div id="col-2">
			<h3>Conductivity and Salinity</h3>
			<p>Easily affected by outside chemical influx, conductivity and salinity measurements are
			especially important in areas near agriculture and roadways. These measurements can be
			taken with multi-parameter sondes and meters as well as conductivity field kits that
			measure ion concentrations.</p>
			
			<h3>Dissolved Oxygen</h3>
			<p>A high ion concentration decreases the amount of oxygen present in water, hindering the
			survival of fish and aquatic plants. Dissolved oxygen measurements require precise
			technology and accurate readings. DO testing has been revolutionized with cutting-edge
			luminescent optical dissolved oxygen technology that enables interference-free, stirring-
			independent equipment held in the palm of the hand.

			<h3>Spot Sampling</h3>
			<p>For efficient and easy water quality readings, Fondriest Environmental offers many multi-
			parameter meters and sondes that fit the needs of any project. Meters are available in
			single- or multi- parameter configurations, while sondes are designed to house many
			different water quality sensors including temperature, conductivity, turbidity, pH, dissolved
			oxygen, chlorophyll and algae.</p>

			<h3>Long-Term Monitoring</h3>
			<p>Long-term monitoring projects require remote, real-time data. Data from the sensors is
			held in a durable data logger, some of which are submersible. Buoy platforms provide
			options for open-water monitoring systems. Data loggers send readings by wireless
			telemetry to a computer or mobile device. There are several telemetry options to fit every
			project including radio for close transmission, cellular, WiFi, Ethernet and Iridium satellite
			for more remote platforms. Data is sent at predetermined intervals adequate for the
			individual project.</p>
